It takes a user's voice command and file context, and returns a structured code action. The `coding_agent` function builds a prompt with relevant context and calls the LLM with a coding-specific system prompt. The response is then parsed into a `CodeAction` dict, which contains a list of edits and an explanation. The agent supports multi-file edits and follows guidelines for generating clean, production-ready code.",
